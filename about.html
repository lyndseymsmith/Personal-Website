    <section>
       <p>
        Hi! I'm Lyndsey—a Designer, Developer, and Artist who thrives at the intersection of creativity and technology. With a passion for crafting intuitive and visually striking digital experiences, I blend design thinking with technical expertise to bring ideas to life.
       </p>

       <p>
        From an early age, I've been drawn to both art and problem-solving, and my journey has led me to explore everything from UX/UI design and front-end development to digital illustration and graphic design. I love experimenting with new tools and technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible.
       </p>

       <p>
        When I'm not designing or coding, you can find me crafting, gaming, hiking, running, or playing music. (I even have a Bachelor's degree in Music Education!) To me, creativity isn't confined to just work—it's a mindset that shapes everything I do.
       </p>

       <p>
        I'm always looking for opportunities to colloborate, innovate, and grow. If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about art, tech, or anything in between, feel free to reach out!
